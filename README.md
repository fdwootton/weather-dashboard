# Weather Dashboard

This application displays current weather conditions and a five-day forecast.  The user may input a city name to view the current weather and five-day forecast.  The users search history is conveniently saved and displayed under the search bar for easy use.  The For this project, I utilized the Open Weather API.  I also used Bootstrap, Moment.js, jQuery and local storage.
